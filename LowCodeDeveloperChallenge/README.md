# Low Code Developer Challenge: Todo List Application

## Overview

Congratulations on making it to this stage of the EcoMap interview process! In this take-home assignment, you'll be building a basic Todo List application. This task is designed to evaluate your problem-solving skills, your understanding of low-code development platforms, and your ability to translate design into functionality.

## Core Requirements

Your Todo List application must have the following features:

1. **Add New Todo Items**: Users should be able to add new Todo items to the list.
2. **Mark Todo Items**: Users should be able to mark Todo items as "Done." Items marked done are styled differently in the UI (see designs).
3. **Delete Todo Items**: Users should be able to delete individual Todo items from the list.

## Bonus Features (Optional)

Bonus features are completely optional. If you choose to implement any of the bonus features, please select no more than THREE to implement.

1. **Login Functionality**: Implement a basic login system. When logging in as different users, the Todo list should be user-specific.
2. **Hide/Show Done Items**: Add a toggle feature to hide or show Todo items that are marked as "Done."
3. **Search Functionality**: Implement a search bar that allows users to filter the list of Todo items.
4. **Multiple Lists**: Add the ability to create multiple Todo lists and toggle between them.
5. **Responsive Design** - Make sure the UI is responsive and displays appropriately on different screensizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Designs

The screenshots below show the proposed design for the Todo list and the Add Todo modal. Please follow the design as closely as possible in your implementation. Fonts, font sizes, and colors do not have to match perfectly, but the general layout should be similar.

## Instructions

1. Use any low-code platform that you are comfortable with. Make sure to indicate which platform you used.
2. If the low-code platform allows for code customization, you are free to use it to achieve the functionalities.
3. Stick as closely as possible to the attached designs.
4. If you complete any of the bonus features, please indicate so in your submission.

## Deliverables

1. A link to the working Todo List application.
2. Any source files, configurations, or documentation needed to understand and run your project.
3. A brief write-up explaining your design choices and any challenges you faced.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Functionality: Does the application perform all the core requirements?
- Usability: Is the application easy to use and understand?
- Code Quality: Is the code (if any) well-organized and documented?
- Design Adherence: How closely does the app adhere to the design mockups?
